This project features a classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's what each part of the project does:

HTML: Sets up the structure of the game board and includes a restart button to reset the game when clicked.

CSS: Styles the game board, cells, and text to make the game visually appealing and user-friendly.

JavaScript: Manages the game's logic:

Handles player moves: Allows players to click on cells to mark 'X' or 'O' based on whose turn it is.
Checks for a win: Detects if any player has completed a row, column, or diagonal with their marks.
Manages ties: Determines when all cells are filled without a winner.
Supports game restarts: Resets the board and allows players to start a new game at any point.
When you open index.html in your web browser, you'll immediately see the Tic-Tac-Toe game ready to play. Clicking on any cell on the grid marks it with 'X' or 'O' depending on whose turn it is. The game notifies you when a player wins or when the game ends in a tie. Use the restart button to begin a new game whenever you like.

Feel free to explore and enjoy playing Tic-Tac-Toe!
